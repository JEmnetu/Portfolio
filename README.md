# Portfolio




## About
* The purpose of this assignment was to update my professional web development portfolio in order to progress towards being employer competative as a web developer. As I progressed through this course, I have learned new technologies and practices that have allowed me to create interesting and useful projects, which I can now display on my portfolio. In addition, I decided to re-create my portfolio site from scratch in order to make the necessary improvements.

* Along with updating my portfolio, I have also updated my Github profile, my Linkedin page, and my Resume. All of these pieces are integral to becoming employer competative.
